# The Movie Database (TMDB)

The movie database web application is a task given to us by our trainers at Re:Coded to test our ability to read and integrate API without any outer help and using Postman, all while coming up with a design without pre-designing the application and with certain requirements. The aim of this website is the ability to visualize any type of movies along with its full information and trailer, along with a search bar, filter by category, sorting by preference, and browsing actors list
